# Limonene-Project
Final year project - models and scripts

Model key:

eco_Lim_v1 = iJO1366 limonene model

eco_Lim_v2 = iJO1366 limonene model in complex media

eco_Lim_v5 = iJO1366 limonene model in optimised media

eco_Lim_v7 = iJO1366 limonene model in minimal media


can_v1 = iJO1366 cannabinoid model

can_v2 - iJO1366 cannabinoid model in complex media

can_v3 = iJO1366 cannabinoid model in minimal media


Script key:

Limonene introduction - addition of biosynthetic reactions

Limonene minimal media - prediction and application of minimal media constraints

Limonene complex media - application of complex media constraints

Limonene optimised media - application of optimised media constraints

Limonene carbon source - script for testing different carbon sources on biomass and limonene production

Limonene flux - example script used for MEV/DXP pathway removal abd removing/increasing individual metabolites

Limonene gene deletions - example script for single and double gene deletions in different medias


Cannabinoid pathway introduction - addition of biosynthetic reactions

Cannabinoid minimal media - prediction and application of minimal media constraints

Cannabinoid complex media - application of complex media constraints
